## How to Use MAVI

- ### Upon initial installation, you should be greeted by the MAVI options page. This is where you will input your information (name, email, phone, and residence hall), so it can be used for autofilling the Maxient page.
- ### Your autofill information can be adjusted at any time by going to MAVI and selecting the "gear" icon.
- ### To go to the Maxient page or use MAVI's autofill features, select MAVI's icon in the extensions list, or use your system's shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Comma for Windows/Other, Command+Shift+Comma for Mac) to display MAVI.
> Autofill features are only available when on the Maxient page.
